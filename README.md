# 💎 Teach a Tot: AI Agent Tutor

> **"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."** — *Alan Kay*

**Teach a Tot** is an adaptive, AI-powered learning platform designed to minimize friction in the learning process. It dynamically generates curriculums, tracks your "Knowledge State" (what you've mastered vs. what you're struggling with), and scans the web for State-of-the-Art (SOTA) trends to keep your learning fresh.

## 🌟 Two Ways to Learn

Choose your interface based on your mood:

1.  **Web App (Visual Mode):** A beautiful React interface for deep reading, diagrams, and exploring topics.
2.  **CLI / TUI (Hacker Mode):** A fast, text-based terminal interface for rapid-fire concept drilling and "flashcard" style learning.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- A **Google Gemini API Key** (Get one [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### 1. Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HsuChe/teach_a_tot.git
cd teach_a_tot
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy......YourKeyHere
```

## 🖥️ Running the Web App

Perfect for visual learners.

```bash
npm run dev
```
> Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in the terminal).

**Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Explore Feed:** Fetches *actual* breaking news/trends (e.g., "DeepSeek updates", "Super Bowl 2026") instead of hallucinated topics.
- **Brain Map:** Click the 🧠 icon to see a visualization of concepts you've mastered vs. those needing review.
- **Adaptive Lessons:** If you fail a quiz, the system remembers and adapts future explanations.

## ⌨️ Running the CLI / TUI

Perfect for speed and focus.

```bash
node cli.js
```

**Key Features:**
- **Lesson History:** Replay any past lesson instantly without re-generating it.
- **Learning Queue:** Queue up topics (e.g., "Rust for Privacy", "Quantum Computing") to learn later.
- **ASCII Art:** Generates diagrams and graphs directly in your terminal.
- **SOTA Scan:** Reads the latest AI/Tech market reports generated by the ecosystem.

### Using the Standalone Executable (Windows)
If you don't want to install Node.js, simply run the pre-compiled executable found in the root folder:

```
tutor.exe
```

## 🧠 How the Memory Works
The system maintains a local "Brain Map" (`brain_map.json`) and "History" (`lessons_history.json`). 
- **Correct Answers** increase a concept's strength.
- **Incorrect Answers** flag a concept as "Struggling".
- Future lessons will specifically target your "Struggling" concepts to reinforce learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/Logic:** Node.js, Google Gemini API (2.5 Flash)
- **TUI:** Chalk, Readline (Native Node)
- **Persistence:** Local JSON Storage (DB)
